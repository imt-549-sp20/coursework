# IMT 549 - Intro to Web Development Coursework

Welcome to Beginning Web Development! This is an entirely online course that will teach you the basics of client-side web development. This is a true beginner's course: it assumes no prior programming experience, and the difficulty level is set for those who have never done any kind of programming before.

## Managing this setup

``` bash
# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
$ npm start

# Build for production
$ npm run build

# Deploy static site to Github pages
$ npm run deploy
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [VuePress docs](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
